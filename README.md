# Web-Crawler assignment by EduGoriila.
## NOTE : I was given the authority to scrap [http://www.thelearningpoint.net/system/app/pages/search?scope=search-site&q=school&offset=0](http://www.thelearningpoint.net/system/app/pages/search?scope=search-site&q=school&offset=0){:target="_blank"} along with it's following 10 pages by [EduGorilla](https://edugorilla.com/){:target="_blank"}. 
## Download [this file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B92OA582_n-wRXpGM0xXUTZhRWUzY3pLYkhSQ0tnWmU5a25j){:target="_blank"} named crawl.sh and run 'bash crawl.sh' on your Linux environment with bash shell installed (No need to clone this repo into your system if you are running crawl.sh).

## If you want to manually do the stuff, then execute the following commands on your linux environment with bash shell installed.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jishnujayakumar/Web-Crawler.git
cd Web-Crawler/Web_Scrapper/
bash run.sh
cat output.csv
